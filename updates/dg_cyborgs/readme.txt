This is a ghost of my AU versions of the characters Gordon Freeman and Darth Vader, they are friends and they'll talk about their past adventures!
I was planning to write more for these two, but I lost motivation and they have since been collecting dust on my computer. However I liked what I wrote for them! So I'm going to send them out as-is.

Their shell was originally supposed to be temporary 〜(￣▽￣〜) so it doesn't match the actual appearance of the characters.

And as I haven't interacted with this project in a long time (and knowing myself) there may be descriptions of gore or injuries.
