LastTalk,"\0\s[0]\1\s[10]\0Where there any interesting rumours about the Earthlings?\n\n\w8\w8\w8\1Let me think, \w8the most well known was a prevailing theory that they had come from an unknown planet that couldn't be found on any map. \w8Which was why they became known as the _EsC_DoUbLe_QuOtE_The People of The Missing Planet._EsC_DoUbLe_QuOtE_\n\n\w8\w8\w8\0I suppose it's an accurate name, \w8they are missing their planet.\n\n\w8\w8\w8\1It was also believed they were from an ancient line of Force users, \w8as to explain why they seemed to have no Force presence.\n\n\w8\w8\w8\0Like if they had been experts at shielding, \w8I'm sure any one of them would love if that was the case.",",",
