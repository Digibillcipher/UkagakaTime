--Wilson's Readme--

Whao! It's The Wretched Scientist!! Aka: Wilson Higgsbury from Don't Starve with a touch more of bri-ish, science, and monstrosity... ouch
His balloon comes included with two fonts I recommend you install, otherwise you can change his talk font under configuration in his menu.
Try not to punch him in the face when you try to access it lol
There is also swearing(¬‿¬)
Have fun! ~Digi_056
