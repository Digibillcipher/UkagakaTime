Don't Starve ballons made from modified in-game assets!


I recommend you install the included fonts which are,

One: (Belisaplumillamanualplus.ttf) Is what Don't Starve uses, but modified to be more readable, and

Two: (WilsonPH-1.2.ttf) Is my own font based on Wilson's handwriting in his map from the Forgotten Knowledge Puzzles.
