If you are updating from any previous version that still uses 2D art as his main shell he'll end up with many unused and outdated files, I suggest you uninstall and reinstall him (without restarting SSP), he should hopefully remember your settings and stats this way, and he won't hold it against you.
I am also not sure if his old update link works anymore, if you want to try updating this, change the link under "On_homeurl" in his string.dic file to "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Digibillcipher/UkagakaTime/main/updates/dg_wrwlison/"



DG - Don't Starve Balloon Nar Update

Increased the text area by a small amount, updated readme, and included my WilsonPH font

You might want to completely re-install it since it's folder name has changed from z_dontstarve to dg_dontstarve
